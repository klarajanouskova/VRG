# Cluster Overview

Our compute infrastructure consists of two types of resources:

- **[Non-RCI Servers](non-rci.html):** Direct-access machines, ideal for debugging and small jobs.
- **[RCI Cluster](rci.html):** A high-performance SLURM-managed cluster for large-scale training.

This documentation gives you a practical overview of how to start using both systems. For more details, always refer to the official documentation:
